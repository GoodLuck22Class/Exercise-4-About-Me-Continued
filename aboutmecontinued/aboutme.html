    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>Greetings user, I like to go by Robinson Segovia, but my actual name is Robinson Hakim Segovia Abdulmalak.</p>
    <p>I am currently a first year <strong>Graphic Design</strong> student at <em>Humber College</em> educational institution.</p>
    <p>Outside of being a Humber College student, I love to go out on solo adventures anywhere and anytime, I specially love going out at night under the veil of the moonlight.</p>
    <p> I also have a family and a partner who I deeply love and would do anything for, I am very lucky to have these people in my life.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <ul> 
<li><strong>Learning Languages: Currently I know two; English and Spanish. Furthermore because of my partner I am learning Russian, and because of my pure interest in the culture of Japan I am also learning Japanese.</strong></li>
<li><strong>History: I Like to read different topics of different eras, mainly about influential figures, politics, human rights, culture, food, epic literature, as well as medicine.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Piercings, and Tatoos: I really love the subculture of piercings and tattoos as well as the whole process of liberating fear through enduring pain, I am actually on the side practicing and learning how to tattoo people as I really love the community</strong></li>
<li><strong>Subcultures: I have always been fond of the underdogs, weirdos, unorthodoxs of society, and it is no surprise to me that I take deep interests in these niche communities</strong></li>
<li><strong>Politics, and Human Rights: As a minority, I have to actively be aware of the politics and human rights of the area that I am in.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Animals: I find it calming to interact with animals, it grounds me and relaxes my nervous systems and muscles. I love snakes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Environment:I was raised in a village close to the ocean, so I have close ties with big body of water. Not only with the ocean but nature as a whole, just like with animals interacting with nature calms me, being poor and native to a third world country I find comfort in nature when technology and the city life becomes too much.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pro Gaming:Currently building my skills and rank to participate in professional gaming. I really believe that E-Sports are the future, and while my body is not in the best physical condition because of an accident I had in childhood, I believe with my peanut brain I will be able to accomplish success in the E-Sport scene.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Robotics/Ai: I have personally never participated in a robotics/ai team respectively, but I have been invited to events and I was just completly mind blown by the enthusiasm and creativity of the community, I was a guest for the Hamilton robotics group that went to Ryerson University to compete.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anime: In my childhood anime is all I watched, as it was one of the cheapest cable options out there during my time in Chile. As I got older I find nostalgia and comfort in the art style, and overall flow of certain stories.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sports: I used to play soccer which helped me build strong legs and stamina,however after said accident I have not played a match in a league again because of fear of injury. I am also interested in sword fighting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Martial Arts: I used to learn Tae Kwon Do. I am currently interested in going back, as the world becomes more messed up.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Art: I really feel connected to abstract, and subliminal works of art. I am also interested in pixel art.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Music: I like all sorts of different kinds of music but I mainly like to listen to alternative tracks.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Photography:I love taking exclusively pictures of the environment and architecture/roads.</strong></li>
</ul>
